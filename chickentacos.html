    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>My family goes <strong>crazy</strong> for these grilled Chicken Street Tacos, and I love how EASY they are to make! Marinated chicken thighs are grilled to perfection and served with warmed corn tortillas, pico de gallo, and cilantro.</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Mexican street tacos are smaller tacos, typically served on corn tortillas.  They are small in size, making it easier for a “street traveler” to enjoy a quick meal. The filling is served on two small corn tortillas so that they don’t rip or tear when piled high with toppings.</p>
    <p>Start to finish in <strong><em>less</em></strong> than 30 minutes? Yes please! I love to marinate the chicken hours ahead, or the night before, to make this meal even more effortless.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pollo para asar (seasoned, boneless, skinless chicken)</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Heat corn tortillas until soft and pliable in the microwave, about 1 minute. Top with chicken, onions, and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
